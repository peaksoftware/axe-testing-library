# Contributing to axe-testing-library

Thank you for your interest in contributing to `axe-testing-library`! This library aims to simplify accessibility testing across Jest, Vitest, and Playwright. We welcome contributions from the community to make it even better. Here’s how you can help.

## How to Contribute

### Reporting Issues

- Check the [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/peaksoftware/axe-testing-library/issues) to see if your bug or feature request already exists.
- If not, open a new issue with a clear title and description. Include steps to reproduce (for bugs) or a use case (for features).

### Submitting Changes

We use a pull request (PR) workflow with Changesets for versioning and changelog management. Follow these steps:

1. **Fork and Clone**

   - Fork the repository on GitHub.
   - Clone your fork locally:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/axe-testing-library.git
     cd axe-testing-library
     ```

2. **Install Dependencies**

   - Ensure you have Node.js and npm installed.
   - Run:
     ```bash
     npm install
     ```

3. **Create a Branch**

   - Branch off `main` with a descriptive name:
     ```bash
     git checkout -b feat/add-new-feature
     ```
     - Use prefixes like `feat/`, `fix/`, `docs/`, or `chore/` to indicate the type of change.

4. **Make Changes**

   - Work on your feature or fix.
   - If your change affects the library’s public API or behavior, add a Changeset (see below).
   - Build locally to test:
     ```bash
     npm run build
     ```

5. **Add a Changeset (if applicable)**

   - For changes that should trigger a version bump (e.g., new features, fixes):
     ```bash
     npx changeset
     ```
     - Select the package (`axe-testing-library`).
     - Choose a bump type (`patch`, `minor`, `major`).
     - Write a concise summary (e.g., "Added support for custom axe rules in Jest").
     - This generates a file in `.changeset/`.

6. **Commit Your Changes**

   - Use clear commit messages:
     ```bash
     git add .
     git commit -m "feat: add custom axe rules to Jest"
     git push origin feat/add-new-feature
     ```

7. **Open a Pull Request**

   - Go to your fork on GitHub and click “New Pull Request.”
   - Target the `main` branch of `peaksoftware/axe-testing-library`.
   - Describe your changes in the PR description. Reference any related issues (e.g., “Fixes #123”).

8. **Review Process**
   - Maintainers will review your PR. Be prepared to address feedback or make adjustments.
   - Once approved, your changes will be merged, and a release PR will be generated by Changesets.

## Development Setup

- **Build**: `npm run build` uses `tsup` to compile the TypeScript source into `dist/`.
- **Entrypoints**: The library has three entrypoints (`jest`, `vitest`, `playwright`) defined in `tsup.config.ts`.
- **Testing**: Add or update tests if your change impacts functionality (details TBD as testing setup evolves).

## Release Process

- We use [Changesets](https://github.com/changesets/changesets) and GitHub Actions to automate versioning and publishing to npm.
- After merging your PR, a GitHub Action will create a release PR with version updates and a changelog.
- Once merged, the package is published to npm automatically.

## Code Style

- Follow the existing TypeScript patterns in the codebase.
- Ensure your code builds without errors (`npm run build`).

## Areas for Contribution

- **Bug Fixes**: Improve reliability across Jest, Vitest, or Playwright.
- **Features**: Add new accessibility testing utilities or integrations.
- **Docs**: Enhance README or add examples for each entrypoint.
- **Tests**: Help establish a robust test suite (currently a work in progress).
